# GMM_Clustering
Clustering data using sci-kit learn and pandas

This code was used as part of a selcetion process for a machine learning/ data science internship

A code was written two classify a 2D Multivariate Gaussian distribution and this code was then generalised so as to produce and then classify a 3D distribution with an arbitrary number 'N' of features. 'N' is a variable near the top of the code which should be adjusted before running the code.
